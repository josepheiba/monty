# The Monty language

## Monty 0.98 is a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it. The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

### This project entails the implementation of various tasks related to stack and queue operations in the Monty scripting language. Each task corresponds to a specific opcode that requires implementation. The opcodes include push, pall, pint, pop, swap, add, nop, sub, div, mul, mod, comments, pchar, pstr, rotl, rotr, stack, and queue.
